Expo-Redux-Firebase-TodoApp

This is a React Native project built with Expo to improve my skills in Firebase and Redux Toolkit. The project aims to demonstrate how to integrate these technologies to build a robust and scalable mobile application.
In this project, I'm integrating my application with a Firebase database and I'm also utilizing Redux Toolkit to effectively manage the application's state.

Technologies Used
React Native: A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
Expo: A set of tools and services built on top of React Native, providing a simplified way to build and deploy mobile applications.
Firebase: A cloud-based platform for building web and mobile applications, providing services such as authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.
Redux Toolkit: A set of tools and libraries for managing state in React applications, providing a predictable and scalable way to handle state changes.
